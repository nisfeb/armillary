::  armillary-btcpay: BTCPay Server's requests and its answers, pure.
::
::    Every arm here builds a request:http a fiber may send, or reads a
::    body a fiber received. Nothing does IO. The api key is a sample,
::    never a constant: a secret lives in settings.json and passes
::    through.
::
::    Import-free like the other three libs, so the JSON getters, the
::    decimal reader and the HMAC below are copied from
::    /lib/armillary-http.hoon and /lib/armillary.hoon rather than
::    imported. A lib that imports a lib cannot build in both the clay
::    desk and the app's code namespace, which is the rule the whole
::    desk follows.
